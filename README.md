# SearchEngine

** All source code is stored under the master branch **

This is a web crawler and search engine. Connect your own database in dbmgmt.py to run the crawler. The search engine reindexes the database everytime you submit a new query. You can modify this in the searchengine.py file if you would only like to reindex the database on command. Video demo is provided below.
